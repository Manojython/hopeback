# hopeback
Different parts of the world are currently affected by the COVID-19. People have lost many things in this war against COVID-19, it could be their friends, families, businesses etc.

Small things which we never paid attention to during our everyday, seem to have taken a priority now. With all the events that are going around, something that always keeps us i.e., humans pushing forward is *Hope*.

This project focuses on delivering the same back to people, by creating a social network for the sole purpose of creating a positive environment and delivering the Hope back to the society.

One might ask what is different here from other social media. This application focuses only on expressing one's concern anonymously and anyone who sees the post can go online and comment with a few good words that fill them with hope.

Since I mentioned about a global population, I would indeed want to make sure that the comments are strictly moderated so that fights/negative comments do not arise in the Forum. But for monitoring such activity, it is not humanly possible to read each comment and allow it to be posted. Which is why, I have created an **AI Model**, which can filter out the negative and positive comments and allow only the positive comments to be posted.
